# Optimize-and-Predict-Emergency-Calls
Create data visuals from public data from the San Francisco Fire Department, along with the ability to anticipate the most likely type of dispatch call given a specific address and time of call

Deliverables:
1. Data Visuals: Display or graph 3 metrics or trends from the data set that are interesting to you.
2. Given an address and time, what is the most likely dispatch to be required?
3. Which areas take the longest time to dispatch to on average? How can this be reduced?
